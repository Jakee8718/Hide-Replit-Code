## Usage

```diff
+    ・ Create a repl
+    ・ Go to replit and make a secret called `SECRET_ENV`
+    ・ Paste your code into secrets
+    ・ Make sure the secret is called 'SECRET_ENV'
+    ・ Import your modules
+    ・ Run your 'py' file!
+    ・ Your code is now hidden from skids, your welcome!
```

## Example Code
```py

import os

secret_value = os.environ['SECRET_NAME']

```
